## Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation of the approaches described in the paper: *"Prompting or Fine-Tuning? Trade-offs in Legal Document Classification with Pre-trained Language Models"* submitted to BRACIS 2025.

The project explores two distinct strategies for automatic legal document classification: supervised fine-tuning of pre-trained models and task formulation through natural language prompting.
Two distinct tasks with increasing levels of complexity were considered: (i) Binary classification of document type, aimed at identifying whether a document belongs to a specific legal category; and (ii) Multiclass classification of legal subject, focused on determining the main theme of an initial petition by selecting from hundreds of specialized labels.
